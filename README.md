# Glaucoma Detection Project

This project helps detect a eye disease called glaucoma using pictures of the eye. It uses a convulutional neural network to predict wether an image of an eye has glacuoma. 

## How it Works

The program uses a pre-labeled set of eye images to learn what glaucoma looks like. It then uses this learning to check new eye pictures.
